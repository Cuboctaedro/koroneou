Pressrelease: Eleni Koroneou Gallery is pleased to present the work of the American photographers Larry Clark and Gregory Crewdson.

Larry Clark (born 1943 in Tulsa, Oklahoma) belongs to the older generation of photographers and continues to be a significant figure in contemporary art and also in film. Best known to the public are his films “Kids” and “Another day in Paradise”. 

The current exhibition will show eleven black and white photographs from his photography books Tulsa and Teenage Lust. Tulsa was published in 1971 and documents the aimless drug use, violence and sex activity of Clark’s circle of friends in his hometown. Tulsa is taken in three protracted series between 1963 and 1971.   
Clark’s second book Teenage Lust was published in 1983 and was subtitled “An Autobiography of Larry Clark”. Teenage Lust is an “autobiography” of his teen past through the images of others. It includes his family photos, more teenage drug use and young male hustlers in Times Square, New York City. More experimental and explicit than Tulsa, Teenage Lust has at its core the rawness, vulnerability and uncertainty of adolescence, a key strain that runs throughout Clark’s work.

Clark’s work is included in important museum collections in the United States, Europe and Asia, including the Whitney Museum, MOCA LA, and the Frankfurt Museum für Moderne Kunst. Clark's groundbreaking first feature film, Kids, was released in 1995 to critical acclaim. 

Gregory Crewdson (born 1962 in Brooklyn New York) belongs to the younger generation. His work is strongly influenced by the cinema. Crewdson falls back on the popular myths of Hollywood cinema and using them to create suggestive pictures of an American society. From the beginning, he understood photographs in a particular way and sees photography as a process of cinematic compression. This is also the case of his first works from the years 1986-88, presented in the current exhibition. They are small-format photos taken without any preparation that show the domestic context as a place of structural loneliness and undefined expectations. It is the first time that this series of works is a exhibited in a Gallery space.

Gregory Crewdson teaches at Yale University, from where he graduated in 1988 and has had solo exhibitions at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Spain (1998) and Emily Carr institute of Art and Design, Vancouver (2000)
