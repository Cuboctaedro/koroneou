Pressrelease: Eleni Koroneou Gallery is pleased to present the 5th solo exhibition of new paintings by the Greek artist Lila Polenaki. The current show will present a series of small and big paintings and some drawings on paper. 

The materials she is using go beyond oil, fabric, lace and carbon to the use of papers of different quality and transparency. Laces, papers distorted in time or marked from the human intervention are all incorporated in her work and become part of a painting process in which the material imitates painting but also painting imitates the material. The painter makes use of various materials that refer mostly to the underlying language of the artistic process while the rough texture of the material itself restores for the lost contact with the world.

In her new work Lila Polenaki uses again the technique of collage. She composes her paintings with acrylic and found material like fabric, Chantilly lace, photographs, parts from posters for advertisement and printed matter from her personal archive. With main instrument the painting, Polenaki addles all these different materials in forms, which describe the woman body, and in color combinations. 
Her pictures, almost psychedelic, curry with them the sense of time, memory and of the human presence and they show a particular feminine psychograph. 

Lila Polenaki studied in Berlin with the professor Bernd Koberling. Her work has been presented in group exhibitions in Kutscherhaus (Berlin), in the Center Crac Alsace (Stransbourg), in the Art Fair (Berlin).
