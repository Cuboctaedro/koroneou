Pressrelease: 

Cut-outs

I make videos performances using myself as the model 
I watch them several times, and take photos from the TV screen of the figures I like.
I print them standard size
I cut the figures out except of where they touch the ground and push them from the back making them into cut-outs standing on the rest of the photo
I place them on every day places and take a picture.
I blow it up.
So all the figures are actually cut-out photos.
