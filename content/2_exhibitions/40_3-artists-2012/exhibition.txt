Pressrelease: Eleni Koroneou Gallery is pleased to present 3 Artists, a group show with the latest work of Eirene Efstathiou, Eftihis Patsourakis and Lila Polenaki.

Eirene Efstathiou presents a series of works within different media; paintings, woodcuts, collages and drawings made in 2011. Her latest work is in continuation to her research on collective memory and the way history and contemporary events are conceived through images and the press. Efstathiou’s drawings present details of interiors from state services in Athens, based on images that the artist herself has taken. “Field Dispatch from the Earnest Cartographer”, is a site research on the institutions that are to be disputed by the current protests. All woodcuts and the table collage are made of photographs and compose a work titled “Proposals for Alternative Message Delivery”, in which, as happens with the paintings of the exhibition Alternate Geographies 1 and Alternate Geographies 2, Efstathiou is undertaking the period of junta, but also contemporary events, in order to examine recent Greek history and deal with notions of resistance, collective life, personal consciousness and other. 
Eirene Efstathiou was born in Athens in 1980. She lives and works in Athens.

Eftihis Patsourakis will present a series of peculiar collages on the floor and on the wall. “Skin” is the result of an assembly of rugs taken from house entrances, which carry their own traces of friction from everyday life. The work exists between public and private space and portrays a daily ritual, connected to the notions of purification and collectivity. Horizons are made of seascapes from unknown and anonymous painters. Placing these seascapes one next to the other, results to an artificially common and continuous horizon. These works pay tribute to the routes of all these non-recognized from the official art history artists. These routes are discussed through the depiction of the sea, the waves and the threatening horizons. Also, these works becomes a “group show” in a peculiar way, reflecting on the concepts of desire, commingling and failure. 
Eftihis Patsourakis was born in Crete in 1967. He lives and works in Athens.

In her work, Lila Polenaki composes vibrant colorful images with acrylics, fabric and the materials and icons used for her collages. Having refined collage technically, a large range of materials are incorporated in her canvases. Floral motifs on fabric, lace, curtains, sheet as well as printed paper, books from childrens books, tissues, sewing patters, letters, personal notes. The artist allows these elements to become the materials of her work, a vernacular iconic vocabulary which is the inspiration to never-ending effort to describe the body, memory and all these passions which relate to female subjectivity. The artist’s painterly surfaces direct roles and postures of the female substance in relation to history and the cosmos.
Lila Polenaki was born in Athens, in 1964. She lives and works in Athens.
