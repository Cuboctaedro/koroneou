Eleni Koroneou Gallery is pleased to present the exhibition “*Knock, Knock*” with new paintings and collages by Helmut Middendorf. The exhibition opening coincides with the launch of Middendorf’s new book, titled "Athens - Studio South" (Publisher: Kerber Verlag). The book includes the works he has created during the period of 1990 up to today in his studio in Athens. Much of the paintings and collages of these last fifteen years, as well as photographic material from his personal archive are being published for the first time in this edition.

In the current exhibition, Middendorf shows again his great versatility in creating his works, by presenting new large-scale paintings and continuing his exploration of abstract art. The paintings show free and spontaneous compositions in vivid and radiant colours along with different logos that Middendorf has collected or created himself. These compositions sometimes combine collaged parts from the artist’s big collection of photo source material or painted copies of cartoons or fragments of drawings. The logos give the paintings a special direction of meaning that can be ironic, absurd or even irritating. 

The exhibition continues with a series of new collages. The collages are an integral part of Middendorf's work, as he has been collecting images from the media (magazines, prints, etc.) systematically since the 1990s, which he then uses as a pool to create his collages. Whether in painting or drawing, photography or collage, the artist can always be seen in search of new approaches and means of expression.
