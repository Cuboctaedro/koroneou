Pressrelease: 

Eleni Koroneou Gallery is pleased to present an exhibition with works by Helmut Middendorf. In the current show, titled “Kick Out the Jams”, Middendorf will present large-scale paintings from the early neo-expressionism period of the 80's along with a series of acrylic on paper from the same period.
 
The paintings combine strong and aggressive colors, powerful contrasts and wide brushstrokes, where the conversion is fast and spontaneous. They are inspired from the direct environment and personal experience, focusing on the human figure, architecture, music and the life in a big city like Berlin. The main themes of the works on paper are similar to the paintings. Middendorf transforms images from the everyday life into large-scale paperworks, reducing reality to selected details.
 
Paintings of Middendorf from the same period will be presented upcoming July in a big group exhibition at the Staedel Museum in Frankfurt, titled “Die 80er. Figurative Malerei in der BRD”.
 
Helmut Middendorf was born in 1953 in Dinklage, Germany. He currently lives and works in Berlin and Athens. Since his early years in the 80s, he was part of the famous group "Neue Wilde" in Berlin. His work has been shown internationally over three decades in numberless solo and group exhibitions, including participations in “Chambres d’ Amis – Collectiepresentatie”, S.M.A.K., Gent, Belgium (2012); “Gegenwartskunst”, Staedel Museum, Frankfurt (2012); “Schlachtpunkt Malerei der 80er Jahre”, Kunsthalle Darmstadt, Germany (2012); “The Last Grand Tour”, Museum of Cycladic Art, Athens (2011); “Neue Wilde”, ARKEN – Museum, Denmark (2010); “40 Jahre Gegenwart” Deutsche Bank - Collection, Luxembourg (2010); “Neoexpressionistic paintings from Berlin: Gift of Susan and Martin Sanders, New York”, Museum of Modern Art Tel Aviv, Israel (2010).
 
Middendorf’s works are included in over 30 museum collections worldwide, as Guggenheim Museum, New York; Aros Museum, Aarhus Denmark; Musée Centre Pompidou, Paris; Museum für moderne Kunst Frankfurt; Museum for Hedendagse Kunst Gent, Belgium and in private collections.
In 2015 a new catalog with works by Helmut Middendorf of the 80s will be published by Kerber Verlag.
